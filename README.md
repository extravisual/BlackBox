# BlackBox
An alpha-adjustable, resizable, always-on-top black box.

## Description
BlackBox allows you to dim or block a portion of your screen by placing an adjustable black box over it.
You can, for example, dim a bright portion of a dark video for easier viewing.
I originally created it to cover a Twitch streamer's on-stream chat to avoid spoilers for a game I hadn't completed yet.

## Requirements
A recent version of Rust.

## Building
`cargo build`

## Running
`cargo run`

## Usage
Click and drag near the center of the box to move the box.
Click and drag near the edges of the box to resize the box.
Right click and drag vertically to adjust the box opacity.
Middle click to enable cursor auto-hiding.
Escape or q to quit.
